# [ A W E S T H E T I C ]

TODO: ADD SCREENSHOT.

# What It Is?
Collection of configurations / dotfies for my Fennel messingabouts, as well as an attempt to daily-drive AwesomeWM, Lite-XL, Luakit, & Friends. This project aims to provide a visually appealing and customizable user experience by leveraging the power and flexibility of Fennel and the versatility of the ecosystems it sits on.

## Prereqs
Sthetic depends on a bunch of projects. Most everything (but `lite-xl` which is in the AUR) are in ArchLinux's repo.
Yes, I used Arch btw when I initially dogfooded `[ A W E S T H E T I C ]`. You don't need to run Arch, obviously but the following command
expects you do and have [yay](https://github.com/Jguer/yay) installed.

> `yay -S fennel luarocks awesowme lite-xl luakit love`

Here's a run down of all the dependencies:
- [Fennel](https://fennel-lang.org/): A Lisp-like syntax for Lua and other nicities.
- [Luarocks](https://luarocks.org/): To manage Lua modules and dependencies.
- [AwesomeWM](https://awesomewm.org/): The Window-Manager And Basis Of 'The DE'.
- [Lite-XL](https://lite-xl.com/): Is A Configurable Text-Editor.
- [Luakit](https://luakit.github.io/): An extensible web browser framework.
- [Love](https://love2d.org/): A game-engine that we'll use to draw UIs.
